 * Shape analyser frontend
 *
 * The frontend is the glue before the backend: it makes sure the file is
 * parsed to an AST, the relevant part of the AST is taken, and passes
 * this AST to the backend. The backend returns a list of changes (e.g.
 * insert an annotation at some position) to the frontend. The frontend
 * modifies the source file by applying these changes.
 *
 * Files are read but changes are not written to disk (the new contents is
 * passed as string). This makes it easier for the IDE to support undo.

 * The main function of the shape analyser frontend (see specs at top of
 * this file).
 * The contents is passed as a filename (instead of e.g. the real contents)
 * because the rest of VeriFast works like that.
